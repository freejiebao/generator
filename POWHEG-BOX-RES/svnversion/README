If you want your pwhg_main executable to write to the log files and to the .lhe
files some information on the SVN status of the directory where the compilation
was performed, do the following:

a) Edit the Makefile in your process directory

b) Insert the line

$(shell ../svnversion/svnversion.sh>/dev/null)

before the pwhg_main target

c) Insert the lines

pwhg_main.o: svn.version
lhefwrite.o: svn.version

at the end of the file.

Do make. Now the executable pwhg_main will write out svn information when
started, and the same information will be written to the lhe file.
The information is hardwired in the executable.
