The procedure step by step:
(Copy the whole MadGraphStuff_MadLoop tree to a new location.)

$ cd MadGraphStuff

$ edit MadGraphStuff/Cards/proc_card.dat

Set the process as in madgraph. Always enter the real emission
process, i.e. the born process plus one j.  For example, for the Z,
enter pp > e- e+ j. Remember also to set the QCD coupling appropriate
for the real emission process.

Set the model of your choice:
  sm          (standard model with massive b quark (4 Flavour scheme)
  sm-no_bmass (standard model with zero b mass (5 Flavour scheme))
  [note that the heft and smckm models are NOT supported]
and update the MultiParticles to reflect the 4 or 5 flavour scheme.

$ ./NewProcess.sh

Use:

$ ./NewProcess.sh -g

if you want to compile with debug information and no optimization.

You will find in the current directory:

Born.f
real.f
init_couplings.f
coupl.inc
Cards/param_card.dat

To generate the virtual corrections, use MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.2.0 (or
later).  Go to the main MG5_aMC_v2_X_X directory and generate the
virtuals by doing

$ ./bin/mg5_aMC <PATH_TO_POWHEG_BOX>/<YOUR_PROCESS>/MadLoop.mg5

To compile the virtual corrections into a single library

$ cd MadLoop5Library/SubProcesses
$ make OLP

Copy the MadLoop5 library to the obj-gfotran directory of the POWHEG process
Copy the MadLoop5_resources directory to the POWHEG process directory

The file Born_phsp.f is a placeholder and must be provided by the user
to complete the POWHEG implementation, that can be compiled with

$ make pwhg_main

Model parameters for MadLoop are read in from the
<YOUR_PROCESS>/MadLoop5_resources/param_card.dat file. Edit it to make
it consistent with the values set in init_couplings.
